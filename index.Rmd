## Bio

Hello! I am a PhD student at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in the department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. I work on Malaria research in the Prigge lab and our work focuses on understanding different biochemical pathways of the parasite. Our ultimate goal is to understand these pathways and identify possible therapeutic targets for malaria drugs. 

Besides my research, I am very much interested in teaching and mentoring. I am also a very big advocate for mental health in academia. Outside of work, you will find me reading, doing yoga or getting crafty.
